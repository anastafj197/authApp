# authApp
Authentication webapp using mongoDB and bootstrap, capabilities include registration, login / logout and encrypted passwords stored in a database. Eventually will have a blog posting functionality.  
  
The only missing component is the node modules folder which you can access by messaging me at frankie.anastasia@gmail.com

Usage:

npm install within project folder     
npm start      
navigate to localhost:3000
